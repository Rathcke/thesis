\section{Distance Oracles in Undirected Planar Graphs}
In this chapter, we show how to construct some of the distance oracles described in Section
\ref{exactPlanar} and \ref{dynamicPlanar} for undirected graphs. This class of graphs are
easier to handle and can lead to better preprocessing, space and/or query times.

\subsection{An oracle with speed-up preprocessing time}
Recall the slow preprocessing time for the oracle described in Section \ref{oracle2}.
