\section{Exact Oracles in Directed Planar Graphs}
\label{sec:sota}
Previous works have given exact distance oracles for directed planar graphs of size
$O(n^{5/3})$ with query time $O(\lg n)$ \cite{cohen2017fast}. This was improved recently
to use $O(n^{3/2})$ space \cite{gawrychowski2017better}. TODO: Other results. \\
\\
We cannot directly adapt the approach used in \cite{cohen2017fast} and \cite{gawrychowski2017better} to work
for the vertex-labeled case as it requires us to know the "target" vertex. However,
depending on $\ell$, we can construct the following distance oracle:\\
\\
\textit{Data structure}. Given the graph $G$ and a number of labels $\ell$ with
$\varepsilon_1 = O(\sqrt{n})$ and $\varepsilon_2=O(\lg n)$, if $\ell\in
[1, \varepsilon_1]$, simply store the matrix of all shortest paths for all nodes to all
labels in the graph. \\
If $\ell\in [n-\varepsilon_2, n]$, we use the same approach as in
\cite{gawrychowski2017better}. \\
If $\ell\in (\varepsilon_1, n-\varepsilon_2)$, we construct an $r$-division with $r=\ell^{2/3}$. For each node within a region, store distances to all
labels in that region in a hash table. For each boundary node, store distances to all
labels outside the region. \\
\\
\textit{Query}. For the query $Q(v, \lambda)$, if $\ell\in[1, \varepsilon_1]$, we simply look up the distance in the matrix
in constant time. \\
If $\ell\in [n-\varepsilon_2, n]$ we compute all distances from node $v$ to the given label (note
that there cannot be more than $\lg n$ nodes with this label. Pick the minimal distance
using $O(\lg n\lg n)$ time. \\
If $\ell\in (\varepsilon_1, n-\varepsilon_2)$ we check if $\ell$ exists in the region of $v$. If so,
we can look up the distance in the hash table
stored for $v$. We also run over all boundary nodes and return the minimal distance
$d(v,w)+d(w,\lambda)$ for some boundary node $w$ in
$O(\sqrt{r})=O(\ell^{1/3})$ time. \\


\section{Recursion}
We can improve the space slightly if we construct the $r$-division recursively. This will
yield space:
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i=1}^{lg_{n/r}(n)} \left(\frac{n}{r}\right)^i
  \sqrt{r\left(\frac{r}{n}\right)^{i-1}} \min
  \left\{\ell,\left(n-r\right)\left(\frac{r}{n}\right)^{i-1}\right\}
\end{align*}
