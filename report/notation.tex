\section{Notation}\label{notation}
For a graph $G=(V,E)$ with label set $L$, we define $|V|=n$, $|E|=m$ and $|L|=\ell$. A
distance $\delta(v,\lambda)$ for a $v\in V$ and $\lambda\in L$ is the distance between
the node $v$ and the nearest $\lambda$-labeled node. Likewise, we use $\delta(u,v)$ to denote
the minimal distance between two nodes $u,v\in V$. \\
We use $Q(v,\lambda)$ or $Q(u,v)$ to denote the queries "What is $\delta(v,\lambda)$?" or
"What is $\delta(u,v)$?" respectively.
