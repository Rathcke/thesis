  Previous work for distance oracles in directed vertex-labeled planar graphs all
  approximate shortest paths, while
  very little research has been done to provide exact distances. However, exact distance oracles in
  the general planar case have been studied and a recent breakthrough by Cohen et al.
  \cite{cohen2017fast} managed to obtain logarithmic query times with truly
  subquadratic space. This thesis aims to match these trade-offs for the harder
  vertex-labeled problem in directed planar graphs. \\
  We give an oracle in a static graph of space $O(n\ell^{2/3})$ with query time $O(\ell^{1/3})$ for the
  number of labels $\ell$. Another result in the static case applies the novel point
  location in weighted Voronoi diagram using $O(n^{3/2})$ space and with
  $O(\text{polylog}(n))$ query time under an assumption on the distribution of the label
  set $L$. We also show how to extend this oracle to support label changes in expected $O(1)$ time. \\
  Lastly, we give an oracle for the dynamic case. The result matches the update time of
  FR-Djikstra \cite{fakcharoenphol2006planar} of $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ extended to also
  support edge insertions and deletions, but with a slightly worse query time.
