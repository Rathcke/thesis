\section{Techniques for planar graphs}\label{techniques}
In this section, we describe techniques popularly used in algorithms for planar graphs.

\subsection{Separators in planar graphs}
A \textit{Jordan curve} is a simple closed curve in the plane. Given a planar graph $G$,
a Jordan curve separator is a curve that intersects $G$ only at vertices. In 1984, Miller
\cite{miller1984finding} showed that for any planar graph with $n$ vertices, there is a Jordan curve
separator of size $O(\sqrt{n})$ such that each new component contains at most $2n/3$
vertices. He further showed that such a separator can be found in $O(n)$ time. \\
Frederickson introduced the \textit{$r$-division} for planar
graphs. Given an $r\in (0,n)$, the division is a decomposition of the graph into
$O(n/r)$ edge-induced subgraphs (\textit{pieces}), where each piece contains $O(r)$ vertices and $O(\sqrt{r})$ \textit{boundary vertices}. A
boundary vertex is a vertex that belongs to multiple pieces. Frederickson showed that
such a division exists for any planar graphs and can be found in $O(n\lg n)$ time. This
was achieved by applying the separator theorem of Lipton and Tarjan
\cite{lipton1979separator}, which states that for any planar graphs, there is a separator
of size $O(\sqrt{n})$ that splits $G$ into two graph each containing at most $2n/3$ of
the vertices. This was further developed
by Klein et al. \cite{klein2013structured}, who gave a $O(n)$ time algorithm to compute
an $r$-division of a planar graph $G$ with the additional property that each piece has a
constant number of \textit{holes}, which are faces of a piece that are not faces of $G$.
\\
The $r$-division we will talk about in this thesis is the one with a constant number of
holes that uses Jordan curves as separators and be computed in linear time. An
illustration of of it is shown in Figure \ref{rdiv}.

  grey with holes in white. Boundary vertices are shown as black circles, interior vertices are shown in
grey. Any edge passing through the Jordan curve goes through a boundary vertex as
indicated by the arrows.}

\subsection{Klein's multiple source shortest path}
Klein's multiple source shortest path \cite{klein2005multiple} is another useful tool for planar
graphs. Given a planar graph with nonnegative weight, we can construct a data structure
of size $O(n \lg n)$ that can answer queries of the following form in $O(\lg n)$ time:
For a source vertex $v$ and a vertex $s$ on the boundary of the infinite face, find the
shortest path from $v$ to $s$. This is especially useful to compute all pairs shortest paths between boundary
nodes in an $r$-division as it requires $O(r\lg r)$ time for a region $R$. \\
The idea is then to compute a shortest path tree $T$ rooted at
$s_i$ and then modifying the tree to get the shortest path tree rooted at the
neighbouring boundary vertex $s_{i+1}$. Using an efficient representation of dynamic
trees that allow operations to be done in amortized $O(\lg n)$ time is possible
\cite{tarjan2005self}\cite{henzinger1999randomized}. Any edge will then join the tree at
most once and leave the tree at most. Since the graph is planar, we have $O(r)$ edges,
giving us the $O(r\lg r)$ running time. \\
The query idea is to use an Euler tour representation of the tree, called $T$, so we can
return the distance from a vertex $u$ to the root $r$ of the tree. Since we need the
correct version of the tree computed during preprocessing, we need a persistent data
structure that remembers changes, so we can recover any state of $T$.

\subsection{Monge property}
Given two ordered sets $A$ and $B$ and a distance function $d$, we say $d$ has the
\textit{Monge property} if for elements $x_1, y_1\in A$ and $x_2, y_2\in B$, where
$x_1\leq y_1$ and $x_2\leq y_2$, then:
\begin{align*}
  d(x_1,x_2)+d(y_1,y_2)\leq d(x_1, y_2)+d(y_1,x_2)
\end{align*}
An example of this is shortest paths distances between boundary vertices in planar graph
given all four boundary vertices lie on the infinite face. 

\subsection{FR-Djikstra}
A \textit{dense distance graph} or DDG is defined over a decomposition of a planar
graph. It is the non-planar graph $G'$ of $G$ where there is an edge $uv$ if both $u$ and
$v$ are boundary nodes with weight equal to the shortest path between the vertices.
Fakcharoenphol and Rao \cite{fakcharoenphol2006planar} gave an algorithm that can answer
distance queries between nodes in $O(\sqrt{n}\lg^2 n)$ after $O(n\lg^3 n)$ preprocessing
time.
