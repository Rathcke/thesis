\subsection{Separators in planar graphs}
A \textit{Jordan curve} is a simple closed curve in the plane. Given a planar graph $G$,
a Jordan curve separator is a curve that intersects $G$ only at vertices. In 1984, Miller
\cite{miller1984finding} showed that for any planar graph with $n$ vertices, there is a Jordan curve
separator of size $O(\sqrt{n})$ such that each new component contains at most $2n/3$
vertices. He further showed that such a separator can be found in $O(n)$ time. \\
Frederickson introduced the \textit{$r$-division}, which is a decomposition of a planar graph into
$O(n/r)$ pieces, where each piece contains $O(\sqrt{r})$ \textit{boundary vertices}. A
boundary vertex is a vertex that belongs to multiple pieces. This was further developed
by Klein et al. \cite{klein2013structured}, who gave a $O(n)$ time algorithm to compute
an $r$-division of a planar graph $G$ with the additional property that each piece has a constant number of \textit{holes}, which are
faces of a piece that are not faces of $G$.

\subsection{Klein's multiple source shortest path}
Klein's multiple source shortest path \cite{klein2005multiple} is useful tool for planar
graphs. Given a planar graph with nonnegative weight, we can construct a data structure
of size $O(n \lg n)$ that can answer queries of the following form in $O(\lg n)$ time:
For a source node $s$ and a node $t$ on the boundary of the infinite face, find the
shortest path from $s$ to $t$. This data structure can be constructed in $O(n \lg n)$
time. TODO: More?
