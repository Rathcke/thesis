\section{Related work}\label{survey}
Distance oracles were introduced by Thorup and Zwick \cite{thorup2005approximate} as a
faster alternative to the SSSP and APSP algorithms. They proposed an approximate distance
oracle, which was later the inspiration for Hermelin et al. when they introduced distance
oracles for vertex-labeled graphs. \\
Hermelin et al. \cite{hermelin2011distance} proposed several results for approximate
distance oracles. In the first result, they give a vertex-labeled distance oracle of
expected size $O(kn^{1+1/k})$ with a stretch of $(4k-5)$ and query time $O(k)$. This can
be constructed in $O(kmn^{1/k})$ time. The data structure is an adaption of Thorup and
Zwick's distance oracle \cite{thorup2005approximate}. \\
In another result, they give a distance oracle which depend on both $n$ and $\ell$. This has
expected size $O(knl^{1/k})$ with query time $O(k)$, but with an exponential stretch of
$(2^k-1)$. This is constructed in $O(kmn^{k/(2k-1)})$. \\
In their third result, they give an oracle capable of handling label changes. This has
expected space $O(kn^{1+1/k})$, stretch $(2\cdot3^{k-1}+1)$, query time $O(k)$ and
handles label changes in $O(kn^{1/k}\lg \lg n)$. \\
\\
Chechik \cite{chechik2012improved} improved the latter two results. Namely, she managed to
reduce the stretch from exponential down to polynomial. She showed two theorems that can
be stated as follows:
\begin{thm}\label{chech1}
  There is a vertex-labeled distance oracle
of size $O(kn\ell^{1/k})$, stretch $(4k-5)$  and query time $O(k)$, which can be
constructed in $O(m\cdot \min\{n^{k/(2k-1)}, \ell\})$.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}\label{chech2}
  There is a dynamic vertex-labeled distance oracle capable of handling label changes in
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})$ time with stretch $(4k-5)$ and space $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/k})$. It has
query time $O(k)$ and can be constructed in $O(kmn^{1/k})$.
\end{thm}
\noindent
However, the focus of this thesis is on exact distance oracles and the approaches used to
approximate distances are often not applicable to obtain exact distance oracles. Below, we outline results for exact distance oracles for both graphs that are labeled and
graphs that are not labeled.

\subsection{The general case}


\subsection{The planar case}\label{cohenplanar}
Given a directed planar graph $G$ with both positive and negative weighted edges, Klein
et al. \cite{klein2010shortest} gives an algorithm with $O(n\lg^2 n)$ preprocessing and
$O(n)$ space that can answer shortest paths. 



Cohen-Addad et al. \cite{cohen2017fast} introduced a (non vertex-labeled) distance
oracle in planar digraphs that required subquadratic space and could answer exact distance queries in
$O(\lg n)$ time. This was the first result to achieve polylogarithmic query time, as previous
results required query time polynomial in $n$ or could only return approximate distances.
This result was later improved in \cite{gawrychowski2017better} from using $O(n^{5/3})$
space to $O(n^{3/2})$ space. They also improved the tradeoff for any space $S\in [n,n^2]$.
That is, for $S\in [n, n^{3/2}]$, they give an oracle with query time
$\tilde{O}(n^{3/2}/S)$. For $S\in [n^{3/2}, n^2]$, they give an oracle with query time
$O(\lg n)$. \\

TODO:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Recursive decomposition using Jordan curves.
  \item Voronoi diagrams
  \item Distances stored
  \item Point location approach
\end{itemize}
We give two exact vertex-labeled distance oracles for planar graphs in \ref{exactPlanar}.
